/// launch) means state-restoration fires in the same process lifetime as the manager, and
/// both the Device tab and the Alarm sheet share the same BLE connection.
///
/// The MetricsRepository opens its on-disk store lazily (on the first load/refresh call),
/// so there is no need to wait for an async factory before showing the UI.
