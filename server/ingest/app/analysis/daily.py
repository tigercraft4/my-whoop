"""
daily.py — the daily analysis orchestrator (Task 2.5).

Unlike the rest of ``analysis/`` (pure functions over stream dicts), this module
TOUCHES the DB: it reads the raw 1 Hz streams for a day, runs the Phase-2 pipeline
(sleep → recovery → strain → exercise), and persists the derived rows idempotently.

Public entry point: ``compute_day(conn, device_id, day)``.

Window choice
-------------
A night's sleep can START the prior evening and END on the target ``day``. To
capture the whole night we read streams over ``[day-1 18:00 UTC, day+1 00:00 UTC)``
(30 h). ``daily_sleep_summary`` then keeps only the session(s) whose END falls on
``day``, so the prior-evening lead-in never leaks into a neighbouring day's metric.

Day STRAIN uses the WHOOP **sleep-to-sleep day** (APPROXIMATE): from this morning's
wake (the end of the sleep session ending on ``day``) to the next sleep onset (the
start of the next detected session in the read window, else end-of-day at day+1
00:00). When there's no night ending on ``day`` we fall back to the calendar day.
HR is sliced from the full read window so the tails either side of midnight count.

Nightly metrics (rebuilt modules)
---------------------------------
- ``avg_hrv`` = ``hrv.nightly_hrv`` last-SWS tiered RMSSD over the merged night
  (replaces the sleep module's coarse 5-min windowed mean); NaN-guarded fallback
  to the sleep summary's avg_hrv.
- HRmax = ``strain.estimate_hrmax`` over the trailing 90 d of HR (observed p99.5
  dominates since age is unknown); fed to both strain and exercise.
- Calibrated nightly signals (ALL APPROXIMATE / un-calibrated) over the sleep
  window: ``spo2_pct`` (windowed ratio-of-ratios), ``skin_temp_dev_c`` (slope ×
  Δraw vs the trailing-30 d median raw baseline), ``resp_rate_bpm`` (Welch peak).

Baseline strategy (recovery)
----------------------------
``recovery_score`` needs a personal baseline (recent norms for HRV / resting HR /
resp). We derive it from the trailing ``_BASELINE_DAYS`` of already-computed
``daily_metrics`` rows, processed through ``baselines.fold_history`` to build a
robust Winsorized-EWMA baseline with:
  - 14-night half-life (EWMA center) with outlier rejection and Winsorization.
  - EWMA-of-abs-deviation spread (robust σ), per-metric floored.
  - Cold-start gate: if the HRV baseline is not yet trusted (< MIN_NIGHTS_SEED
    valid nights), ``recovery_score`` returns ``None`` and the metric column is
    left null for that day.

On the very first run (no history) the baselines are in "calibrating" status and
``recovery_score`` returns None — meaning the day's recovery column is null until
enough nights accumulate.  This is the honest behavior (vs. anchoring at 60).

Resp note: resp has no dedicated ``daily_metrics`` column.  We carry nightly resp
values in a rolling list built from the session-level resp mean (also computed here).
Since we only have access to prior ``daily_metrics`` rows (which don't store resp),
the resp baseline for the very first run will always be None and the resp term is
dropped in the composite.  This is acceptable — resp is the lowest-weight term (W=0.05)
and is documented as mostly an illness flag.

Timestamp coercion
------------------
``read.query_stream`` returns ``ts`` as tz-aware datetimes (psycopg). The analysis
modules accept datetime OR epoch via ``analysis._utils.to_epoch``, but to keep the
contract explicit and the persisted session times unambiguous we coerce every row's
``ts`` to epoch seconds in ``_load_streams`` before handing the dict to the pipeline.
